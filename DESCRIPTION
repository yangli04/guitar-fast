Description: Performance-optimized fork of the Guitar Bioconductor package.
	Visualizes the distribution of RNA-related genomic features with respect
	to the landmarks of RNA transcripts (TSS, start codon, stop codon, TES).
	3-6x faster than the original Guitar package through vectorized operations
	and reduced bootstrap iterations. Based on Guitar v2.26.0 by Cui et al. (2016).
