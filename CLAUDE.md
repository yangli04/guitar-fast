## Goal
This is not a very well optimized library (Guitar), which speed is VERY SLOW. I want you to optimize the speed of this package from data loading, computing and the final output.

## Steps
1. Make a environment using micromamba and activate it each time, which should only be constructed for this package and not interfere with the R environment previously existed. 
2. Run test code mentioned in their package to confirm it works now. 
3. Find out the problem of slow code and optimize it. 
4. Compile new package and write docs for changed API.
