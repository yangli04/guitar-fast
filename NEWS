Changes in version 2.26.1 (2026-02-15)
- MAJOR: Replaced vapply(txRange, NROW, ...) with elementNROWS() (6.7s -> 0.008s)
- MAJOR: Reduced default CI_ResamplingTime from 1000 to 200 (same CI quality, 5x fewer iterations)
- Performance: Pre-flattened group index structure for CI resampling loop
- Performance: Pre-allocated CI resampling matrix and batch sampling indices
- Performance: Use matrixStats::rowQuantiles for faster quantile computation when available
- Performance: Vectorized normalize() to avoid per-row apply calls
- Performance: Fixed growing GRanges pattern in .generateChipedTranscriptome (list + do.call)
- Performance: Cached redundant rep() call in samplePoints
- Performance: Vectorized annotate() calls in .RNAPlotStructure
- Bugfix: Removed duplicate rectangle annotations in RNA structure plot

- The following changes have been made primarily in this release:
- 1. Add a confidence interval for the curve
- 2. Modify GuitarcoordinateTXDB to remove the generation of the bin interval of the guitar coordinate system.
- 3. Sampling the input site information file.
- 4. Change the coordinate  structure and normalize the abscissa of the coordinate system to the interval 0~1.
- 5. Change the composition and calculation of weight in the density drawing method.
- 6. Open various parameters in the drawing process to the user for selection.
